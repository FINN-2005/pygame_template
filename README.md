# `pygame_template`: Your Lean Pygame Starting Point 🚀

This is my (almost) 'NO FLUFF' Pygame framework designed to get you up and running quickly.

## Installation 🛠️

### Install directly with Git.

    pip install git+https://github.com/FINN-2005/pygame_template.git

### Otherwise:

1. Clone the repo or download and extract the zip file
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/FINN-2005/pygame_template.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Directory:** Step into the newly created folder.

    ```bash
    cd pygame_template
    ```

3.  **Install the Package:** Use pip to install the framework. The `.` tells pip to look for the `setup.py` file in the current directory.

    pip install .
    ```

That's it! You're all set to start building your awesome Pygame projects with a clean and efficient foundation. ✨
